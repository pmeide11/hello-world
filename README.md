# hello-world
# First foray into github. 
# The purpose of this endeavor is to hopefully be able to leverage existing projects in the openstreetmap space. 
# I have found that the pre-compiled maps available for download for the Garmin GPS platform don't zoom properly. 
# I expect to build a map that zooms as expected.
